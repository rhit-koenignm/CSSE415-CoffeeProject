# CSSE415-CoffeeProject

If you'd like to make use of our dataset, the train_data and test_data_balanced csvs are well suited to use when running classifiers or regressors on the data.

Note: test_data.csv and test_data_balanced.csv are different because we needed to rebalanced our test data to have an equal number of 'Excellent' and 'Very good' quality coffee.

If you'd like to see the results of our DecisionTree, run the DecisionTreeDemo notebook file from start to finish.
